## Flexmark Plugin

### Wish List

* [ ] Fix: add reference contributor for `SPEC_RESOURCE` strings otherwise relative resource
      names are not renamed.
  + [ ] TEST: add rename tests
* [ ] Add: inspection & quick fixes for Java
  * [ ] use of getChar().xxx() instead of available delegated methods
* [ ] Add: flexmark spec file:
  * [ ] parse `margin` option to display vertical guide at set margin
  * [ ] parse and use extension of spec example
  * actions:
    * [ ] Convert carets to caret markup
    * [ ] Convert caret markup to carets
    * [ ] Copy Node-AST for source using flexmark-test-utils AST rendering
    * [ ] Copy Psi-AST for source using `PsiTreeAstRenderer` rendering
* [ ] Add: Java inspection for `<? extends DataHolder>.get(DataKey<?>)` and offer quick fix to
      change it to `DataKey<?>.get(<? extends DataHolder>)` to make it null immune.
* [ ] Add:completion contributor for `SPEC_RESOURCE` strings which provides spec md files in
      module.
* [ ] Fix: Handle variable spec example sections with front matter configuration. If not
      provided default to 1-Markdown, 2-Html, 3-Ast for 1
* [ ] Add: validation for unused SPEC_RESOURCE, some absolute spec resource line markers show as
      missing in `flexmark-java`, cause was a spurious spec name declaration but never used for
      tests in that class, overridden by subclass.
* [ ] Add: separate color option for flexmark option names which are not built in and are all
      caps.
* [ ] Fix: flexmark ast highlight ranges should adjust highlight range for embedded caret and
      selection markers so that start/end properly reflect text positions after markers are
      removed.
- [ ] Add: inspection for Java classes which define builtin option names, they will be ignored
      so should not be used.
- [ ] Add: reverse highlight lookup for AST based on source caret position. Choose first
      smallest range that contains the caret in source.

### Issues

+ [ ] Add: completion for custom option should add `[]` and place caret inside
- [ ] Fix: cached data for flexmark java info should be resolved during computation. Related
      files will be invalidated if modified anyway. If precomputed then no access to related
      Java files' cache will be needed.
  - [ ] `resolvedSpecFiles`
  - [ ] `resolvedOptionDefinitions`
  - [ ] `BasedSequence.subSequence(0, 0)` instead of `BasedSequence.getEmptyPrefix()`
  - [ ] `BasedSequence.subSequence(length(), length())` instead of
        `BasedSequence.getEmptySuffix()`

## Enhanced

### Refactoring - Split Plugin

* [ ] Add: Extension API for enhanced features
  * Add: generic settings extension points:
    * [ ] Add: extension point for language based inline code completions
      * [ ] Needed functions:
        * to have completions for class and nested identifiers
        * to have these provide references to classes in question
        * to be able to navigate to these
        * be able to refactor these (Validate that enabling text search for refactoring already
          does this.)
      * To Be done:
        * [ ] Fix: move Java completion for inline code to extension
        * [ ] Add: PhpStorm completions for inline code to extension
        * [ ] Add: WebStorm completions for inline code to extension
    * [ ] Fix: all html provider extensions to be usable from Java, get rid of Pachinko
          inheritance and implementation code
      * [ ] Fix: Move all HTML generation helpers to utils library
      * [ ] Add: extension points for modifying generated HTML by HTML providers
      * [ ] Add: extension points for modifying fenced code rendering
    * [ ] Add: ability to list, download, install and uninstall Markdown Navigator extension
          plugins.
* [ ] Add: move all link and image options (for address format) to rendering profile settings
      not under application settings. This will allow setting default formats based on scope to
      customize for different files.
* [ ] Fix: Review `TODO`, `HACK` and `IMPORTANT` comments to be mapped for clarification of
      urgency of action, todo is too generic, hack is a cautionary label, does not mean fix. If
      it does, then use `FIX: hack`. `IMPORTANT` should be used on important fixes not
      cautionary notes, use `CAUTION` or less critical `NOTE` for that.
  * Actionable:
    * `IMPORTANT` - broken needs fix ASAP.
    * `FIX` - broken or limited for edge cases, works for common uses
    * `FEATURE` - improvement on existing or new functionality,
    * `OPTIMIZE` - no real changes but improve performance or user response,
    * `REFACTOR` - no real change but improve implementation by cleanup,
    * `DEPRECATED` - deprecated in IDE, add note when can migrate to new API and preferably
      commented out migration code,
  * Informational:
    * `CAUTION` - important things to keep in mind before adding or changing code, otherwise
      high probability of breaking without immediate errors
    * `ISSUE` - code changes related to specific issue
    * `NOTE` - additional information that may not be obvious and good to know.
    * `HACK` - mark kludged solution that does not need immediate addressing because it is a
      working kludge or has no easy workaround.
    * `QUERY` - unresolved curiosity, probably unnecessary or buggy code. Add enough detail to
      make sense of it 3 months from time of writing.
    * `NOT USED:` - unused class, or function, consider removing
  * Not to be used:
    * `TODO` - overused and ambiguous, replace with actionable labels
* [ ] Fix: consolidate basic/enh for wrap on typing, keep verbatim trailing, keep trailing
      spaces settings.
* [ ] Fix: use cached definition count map in intentions, inspections and annotator to quickly
      determine if need to search for actual reference definitions for multi-defined references
      or can skip expensive search since only 1 is defined.
* Fix: ListItem actions to handle basic/enhanced variations
  * [ ] Test: list item actions, licensed/unlicensed
* Add: Element format API `MdFormatElementHandler`
  * [ ] Test: element format licensed/unlicensed
* Fix: add custom element injection of css resources for rendering API in `MdParserExtension`
  * [ ] Test: admonition rendering
  * Fix: move admonition resource injection to admonition parser extension
* Fix: separate error reporting into installable extension for basic version, bundle in enhanced
  version.
* Add: ability to download and install markdown navigator extensions

### Wish List

+ [ ] Fix: alternative GitHub raw link format shows as undefined:
      `https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/master/misc/image/module_dependencies.png?raw=true`
  + [ ] Fix: handle alternative GitHub raw link format:
        `https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/master/misc/image/module_dependencies.png?raw=true`
  - [ ] Add: intention to convert between raw link formats
+ [ ] Fix: [#748, Toolbar is completely hidden when window is not wide enough]
* [ ] Fix: list item context for easy list modifications which always result in correct list:
  * [ ] Fix: rewrite list ENTER & BACKSPACE handlers in terms of list action being performed
        rather than pachinko text manipulation:
    * [ ] add new item before: with params `loose`, `isTask` and `itemText`
    * [ ] add new item after: with params `loose`, `isTask` and `itemText`
    * [ ] remove item prefix: with params `taskOnly` true if only removing task prefix,
          `isolate` if true and removing all prefixes will isolate resulting paragraph from
          previous/next task items with blank lines.
    * [ ] change item prefix: for ordered items changes the first item's numbering, for
          unordered changes the bullet character used.
  * [ ] Fix: list item indentation quick-fixes/actions should change the indentation of child
        elements otherwise it messes up the list structure.
  * [ ] Fix: task toggle on last line of file without EOL does not work properly
  * ordinal changes for items:
    * [ ] always adjust child element indentation to parent item indentation
    * [ ] optionally renumber sibling items
    * [ ] optionally wrap text to reflect new indentation for item and child items
* [ ] Add: Markdown Nav debug trace config page with all debug traces and description
  * [ ] Add: debug trace registration/definition with description for each and nesting
* [ ] Add: translation options dialog to Translate Document action to allow selecting
      translation criteria.
  * [ ] Add: translate to clipboard option.
* [ ] Fix: flexmark example options edit dialog:
  * use check box searchable list
  * use dimension size key
  * place selected options at the top of the list, followed by any options used in the file,
    then built in options, then all available options
  * options used in file, built in and available should be alphabetically sorted within their
    category.
* [ ] Fix: Add Markdown file templates as per
      [fileTemplates.j2ee](jetbrains://idea/navigate/reference?project=intellij-community.master&fqn=fileTemplates.j2ee)
      and
      [DevKitFileTemplatesFactory](jetbrains://idea/navigate/reference?project=intellij-community.master&fqn=org.jetbrains.idea.devkit.DevKitFileTemplatesFactory)

  ```xml
  <fileTemplateGroup implementation="org.jetbrains.idea.devkit.DevKitFileTemplatesFactory"/>
  ```
* [ ] Fix: style toggle action should work on styling spans and take which elements could be
      wrapped by which into account. For example inline code cannot wrap any style because there
      are no styles inside inline code. So inline code should wrap all text nodes inside the
      style being wrapped instead. Similarly, italic inside bold when their contents match will
      result in bold inside italic instead because Italic is always on the outside. ie. need
      more sophisticated style toggle logic.
* [ ] Add: folding to replace typographic characters.
* [ ] Fix: shuffling of repository files invalidates links in old issue comments to files. See
      if it is possible to find all comments with links so they can be updated.
* [ ] Fix: Move preview settings which are Monitor specific (Grey scale font smoothing) to
      Application settings. Review others that may need moving to IDE shared settings from
      project settings.
* [ ] Add: HTML Export option to select an alternate profile to use for exported text. This way
      export and rendering can have completely different profiles for generated HTML. Will only
      apply to export and when selected all export settings will come from the HTML Export of
      the selected profile.
* [ ] Fix: When pasting into fenced code (non-markdown) or indented code or any other
      non-markdown content element, do not convert HTML content or ask.
* [ ] Add: project configuration to add new file context menu items to create files from
      templates in specific directories.
- [ ] Add: configuration for repeated prefixes in items, which would be copied when
      adding/splitting an item. In other words they would be treated equivalent to task item
      marker prefix. That way standard: `Add: `, `Fix: `, `Break: ` and `Deprecate: ` prefixes
      would be automatically copied.
  - [ ] Add: option for treating these as part of the list item's suffix, ie. continuation lines
        aligned to text after this suffix.
- [ ] Fix: markdown test file loader:
  - [ ] Fix: use task with progress in background
  - [ ] Add: file range, file list and max files to load
  - [ ] Add: generate stats and save them with project
- [ ] Add: inspection for unnecessary URL encoding of link and link anchor with quick fix to
      `urlDecode()`.
  - [ ] test using `linkRef.fileToLink(linkRef.linkToFile()) != linkRef.getFilePath()` means
  - [ ] allow fix in file option there are unnecessary URL encoded chars in address.
- [ ] Add: option for auto injection of inline code language with language selection
- [ ] Add: json to table extractor.
- [ ] Add: plain paragraph folding when > 1 line and not list item text or footnote text, leave
      trailing blank line but include EOL
- [ ] Fix: see if can make change all intentions on a sub-menu same way as IDE in intentions
- [ ] Fix: disable the non-ascii characters in identifier inspection for markdown documents
- [ ] Add: option to disable list item re-ordering setting and toggle action that would override
      code style settings when this option is selected.
- [ ] Fix: add IDE action to invoke after HTML export in the profile.
      [#739, Suggestion: Option add a generated a tree view of files and folders to HTML export],
- [ ] Add: [#665, Add support to render code from links like GitHub web UI does], add links with
      special title string to use for embedding link in file.
- [ ] Fix: :red_circle:
      [#774, Add formatter option to add blank lines around fenced-code blocks]

### Issues

+ [ ] Test: type handler tests basic/enh
+ [ ] Doc: moved translation options to editor settings (from Debug)
+ [ ] Doc: moved flexmark rendering options. (from Debug)
+ [ ] Doc: added option for text hex dialog to Debug
+ [ ] Doc: added option for size preferences dialog to Debug
+ [ ] Fix: format/wrap on typing for task items with tab after marker changes first character of
      text and inserts space after it. ???
+ [ ] Doc: changed markdown live template element shortcuts to start with `,,` instead of `.` to
      remove accidental live template insertion when typing text.
+ [ ] [StackTraces_ToDo.txt](StackTraces_ToDo.txt)
+ [ ] Test: complete formatter tests for all elements
+ [ ] Fix: [#780, False positive for "Unresolved link reference"]
  * Allow `Reference` link map entry to map to empty string. This should be used to remove the
    undefined reference error while not rendering the reference in preview but treating it as
    plain text.
+ [ ] Add: [#779, Ignore character casing when checking for matching header]
+ [ ] Fix: fixture tests do not restore enhanced document settings between tests.

+ [ ] Fix: [#764, Styling the preview pane], add toolbar button to go to settings/profile for
      the file.
+ [ ] Doc: Attributes extension space between **inline**, not just plain text, and attribute
      attaches attribute to parent.
* [ ] Reproduce: table element formatting fails with "table is no longer a markdown table".
* [ ] Test: sim toc blank line spacer flag was coming from project defaults not profile of the
      file containing the toc.
* [ ] Fix: wrap on typing `* [ ]` causes the last `]` to move caret to next line
* [ ] Add: ability to enter authentication information on a per site basis to allow JavaFX to
      access content on such sites for preview.
* [ ] Add: intention to sort ordered list by item number

## EAP Release

### Next 2.9.0.2xx/2.9.7.2xx - Dev Build

+ [ ] Fix: `Add spec test caret selection` should paste caret position with selection if there
      is a selection and remove any caret/selection markup in or immediately around the
      selection.
+ [ ] Fix: `Add spec test caret selection` remove any caret/selection markup in or immediately
      around the selection.
+ [ ] Fix: Add spec test selection is not available in list items
+ [ ] Fix: Remove unused static `LOG` in classes
+ [ ] Add: Option on paste link ref to update line references and link text when selection
      reference is pasted and text matches old link/anchor selection ref, then replace the whole
      link
+ [ ] Add: HTML panel update on settings change, now EnhDocumentSettings change does not cause
      markdown re-highlight nor preview update. Possibly, notifications on EnhDoc changes are
      not working.
+ [ ] Fix: check if HTML rendering in background thread improves typing response. In large
      documents there is a small but noticeable lag, which does not exist when preview is
      disabled. This is mitigated by setting update delay to 150 ms or higher. However, the
      response is still a tiny bit sluggish with preview on.
+ [ ] Fix: Add config to use GitLab config for remote link cache for links to configured VCS
      GitHub repositories.
+ [ ] Fix: Add config to use authentication information in requests for remote content for
      preview, remote link cache and intentions.
+ [ ] Add: generic methods to convert between PSI and flexmark nodes:
  + [ ] Take any `MdElement` and get a flexmark `Node` for it.
  + [ ] Take replace `MdElement` with flexmark `Node` by replacing its text the same way
        verbatim content is replaced.
  + [ ] Psi to flexmark must handle adding any references from the main file to the snippet for
        parsing to flexmark node so nothing is lost.
  + [ ] Fix: change all markdown manipulations to: convert to flexmark, manipulate, convert to
        psi.
+ [ ] Fix: Register post startup activity in services that need this:
  + [ ] `MdLinkResolverManager`
+ [ ] Add: `MdTabOverride`/`MdBackTabOverride` should treat empty items differently:
  + [ ] treat empty items as having no children, should only indent/unindent the item in all
        cases.
  + [ ] should roll-over to highest parent indentation level when the item can no longer be
        indented to allow tab to be used to adjust sub-item to parent item
  + [ ] Non-Empty items on indent should show a pop-up with:
    + [ ] Item Only: select as default if the item's recent child content is empty
    + [ ] Item with Children before un-indent: select as default and only show if item was
          un-indented and acquired more children because of it and its recent child content is
          not empty.
      + [ ] Tab/BackTab of item with recent child content only should reset the timestamp on
            recent child content cache information in the file.
    + [ ] Item with Children: select as default if the item has not recently acquired children
          on un-indent. This option will indent item with children.
    + [ ] Add: recent child content for items which are un-indented and acquire more children
          because of it.
      + [ ] cached by item's line number in the file,
      + [ ] total file lines at creation
      + [ ] Undo/Redo should clear this value.
      + [ ] Only one item per file is kept track.
      + [ ] Clear if total file line count is different from actual file line count
* [ ] Fix: remove formatter and use flexmark formatter for document format to eliminate
      duplicate code.
* [ ] Add: reverse task list item sort order on format. To keep high priority items at the
      bottom of the list.

### 2.9.0.233/2.9.7.233 - EAP Build

* Fix: wrap on typing caret adjustment on space between spliced words
* Fix: wrap on typing caret adjustment on space after non-space and before keep at start of line
  elements.

#### 2.9.0.231/2.9.7.231 - Dev Build

* Add: Add visible LS intention action `➥`
* Fix: remove log4j dependency from `JavaFx-WebView-Debugger`
* Fix: link mapped image links showed unresolved in edge case conditions. Easiest way to
  properly map them is to use a repo relative address format so they will resolve everywhere.
* Fix: gutter icons for links do not show in tables because leaf types for tables must be
  matched by token type suffix.
* Fix: add image link ref gutter icon type
* Fix: wrap on typing caret adjustment on backspace in continuation indent prefix
* Fix: wrap on typing caret adjustment on backspace when on first non-blank of continuation line
  to splice to last word of previous line.

#### 2.9.0.229/2.9.7.229 - Dev Build

* Fix: conversion from Smart to based to extract more source information from segmented sequence
  and mapped sequence.

#### 2.9.0.227/2.9.7.227 - Dev Build

* Fix: enable table formatting in document formatter as temp measure to make formatter feature
  complete.
* Fix: wrap on typing with new library use.
* Add: code style option to assign task priority to ordered list items for formatting sorting.

* Fix: missed disposable in plugin application settings

#### 2.9.0.225/2.9.7.225 - Dev Build

* Add: flexmark spec line marker option definition data to cached file data.
* Remove: from plugin-test-util/lib and plugin-util/lib from git, they are duplicated in Mia and
  Md
* Fix: Add `MdLineSelectionFakePsiElement` resolve caching to `MdCachedResolvedLinks` so the
  file is re-analyzed when the target is modified.
* Fix: Add all inherited Java super classes as dependencies to spec file even if they do not
  define options or have `SPEC_RESOURCE` literal. The spec file cached data should still be
  invalidated when those files are changed. They may define options and spec literal later.
* Fix: `ProjectFileMonitor` to invalidate the key before restarting code analyzer otherwise the
  key may not be recomputed and code analyzer will re-run with stale data.
* Add: `ProjectFilePredicate.getDependentFile()`, if non-null value is returned then it will be
  passed to `DaemonCodeAnalyzer.restartFile()` when `ProjectFileMonitor` invalidates the
  dependency through the predicate or by detecting that dependency is not valid. Any key which
  wants to restart its containing file code analyzer should return the file from this method.
* Add: `RestartableProjectFileDependency` which creates a default restartable predicate that
  always returns true for the test but has the effect of restarting code analyzer for the file.
  Adding an instance of this as a dependency of any key will restart code analyzer on the file
  when the dependency is invalidated.
* Fix: document format adds blank line after last nested list-item if followed by a blank line,
  even when the blank line is after the end of the list
* Fix: document format messes up table because it does not include the table prefix for the
  first line.
* Fix: project disposed checking in ProjectFileMonitor.

#### 2.9.0.223/2.9.7.223 - Dev Build

* Add: option to alias `latex` and `math` for GitLab math if `latex` is an available language.
  * `latex` fenced code gets rendered by Katex if extension enabled
  * `math` block and inline elements get `latex` language injection
* Add: Language injection host test case
* Add: GitLab inline math as language injection host
* Add: `MdLanguageProvider` extension point to add aliases and resolve language info to
  language.

#### 2.9.0.221/2.9.7.221 - Dev Build

* Fix: diagnostic/4355, invalid regex for invalid link address
* Fix: formatter to use max task item from item or descendants for sorting (not item
  priority*10+descendant).

#### 2.9.0.219/2.9.7.219 - Dev Build

* Fix: move components to services
* Fix: missed dispose disposables

#### 2.9.0.217/2.9.7.217 - Dev Build

* Add: Goto Rendering profile settings button
* Add: Goto Rendering profile link to show rendering profile/scope dialog
* Add: Code style margin override to rendering profile.
* Fix: pasting selection reference (with anchor) on link address which already has a ref anchor
  causes ref anchors to be duplicated. Ref anchor should be replaced when pasted link has one.

#### 2.9.0.215/2.9.7.215 - Dev Build

* Fix: pasting selection reference (with anchor) on link address which already has a ref anchor
  causes ref anchors to be duplicated. Ref anchor should be replaced when pasted link has one.
* Fix: `Remove caret and selection markup` does not remove markup in selection.
* Fix: change use of `FileContentUtil.reparseFiles` to `FileContentUtilCore.reparseFiles`
* Fix: components moved to services
* Fix: formatter incorrectly wrapped text for list items whose complete task item marker was
  removed.
* Fix: formatter to not change bullet item marker for task items when prioritized task option is
  enabled.

#### 2.9.0.213/2.9.7.213 - Dev Build

* Add: task list item priority by type of bullet list marker. Change task item icon in structure
  view to reflect this. Only applies to incomplete tasks:
  * Add: sorting on format to take priority into account if `Enable Task List Item Priority` is
    enabled. `Has Incomplete First` will use priority of item and max priority of its sub-items
    and sort in order of descending priority.
  * `+`: high priority, bold red icon
  * `*`: normal priority, normal red icon
  * `-`: low priority, normal blank icon
  * empty tasks have normal grey icon regardless of priority
  * complete tasks have normal grey checked icon regardless of priority

#### 2.9.0.211/2.9.7.211 - Dev Build

* Fix: preview editor initialized to default typing delay instead of one in settings.

#### 2.9.0.209/2.9.7.209 - Dev Build

* Add: `As URL` option for `Copy Upsource Reference`

* Fix: Use `com.intellij.testFramework.builders.JavaModuleFixtureBuilder#addJdk` for test JDK
  builders
* Add: `Add test spec example` intention

#### 2.9.0.205/2.9.7.205 - Dev Build

* Add: `Copy Upsource Reference` for copying upsource refs in intellij-community sources.
  Selection start/end offsets can be used for nav highlight Upsource uses git path for source
  file. ie. relative to project base directory
  `upsource://platform/platform-api/src/com/intellij/ide/browsers/BrowserLauncherAppless.kt?nav=3717:3923:focused&line=114&preview=false`
  * nav=startOffset:endOffset,
  * line appears to be line number,
  * preview=false no idea.
* Fix: Add custom protocol to line marker and `MdUrlFakePsiElement` for navigation
  * Add: icon for `jetbrains://` custom protocol
  * Add: icon for `upsource://` custom protocol
  * Add: icon for custom protocols
  * Add: Gutter icon option for custom protocols
* Fix: change markdown live template element shortcuts to start with `,,` instead of `.` to
  remove accidental live template insertion when typing text.
* Fix: `ProjectFilePredicate` test to return `true` when dependency is still valid.
* Fix: put heading folding settings to one line
* Fix: put flexmark section folding settings to one line
* Fix: line selection anchors to files not updated when files are edited only when saved.
  Applies to all links to other files. Now on any change the links to that file are removed from
  the cache so they get recomputed.

#### 2.9.0.203/2.9.7.203 - Dev Build

* Fix: optimize link resolver to pre-filter files by name, then by fixed prefix before applying
  the regex for full match test. 2x-4x faster link resolution with large number of files.
* Fix: use `linkRef.linkToFile()` in `MdCachedResolvedLinks` instead of `urlDecode()` which does
  not work for `WikiLinkRef`
* Fix: reference search scope failed to pass project to hand-rolled effective scope
* Fix: use `resolve()` in `MdLineMarkerProvider` for all except wiki links or links to wiki
  pages.
* Fix: use `resolve()` in `MdAnnotator` for all except wiki links and wiki page targets and if
  not resolved then use loose matching to see what can be fixed. Right now `MdAnnotator` is not
  taking advantage of resolved link cache and for large files with tons of links it is very
  slow.
* Add: per file resolved link cache. Amazing speed up for preview and all functions which
  require resolved links.
* Fix: url encoded links do not resolve if they have sub-directories in the link address.

#### 2.9.0.201/2.9.7.201 - Dev Build

* Add: Paste Image option to checker transparency background
* Add: Flexmark Example Option gutter icon option for SPEC_EXAMPLE
* Fix: use singleton list cell renderer for Java line marker spec options.
* Fix: use singleton or class for list cell renderers for markdown line markers: TOC, spec
  option, emoji, referencing and file elements

#### 2.9.0.199/2.9.7.199 - Dev Build

* Fix: spec resource resolving in resources.
* Fix: remove `&nbsp;` use in flexmark spec examples. No longer needed for GitHub, since it
  switched to CommonMark processor.
* Fix: HTML escape quotes in line marker tooltip description in rendered spec actual output.

#### 2.9.0.197/2.9.7.197 - Dev Build

* Fix: flexmark option definitions not showing line markers for interfaces defining options with
  rendering subclasses far down the class hierarchy

  supers.
* Fix: annotate flexmark option not defined in all test case classes as warning and add
  navigation quick fix to class(es) missing definition.
* Fix: store file cached data in IDE Key<> for each file instead of a `PsiMap` keyed on the
  file.

#### 2.9.0.195/2.9.7.195 - Dev Build

* Fix: split `base/` platform/java test cases to `plugin-test-util` module.

      * LINK_REF_FTP
      * LINK_REF_MAIL
      * LINK_REF_GITHUB

  `()` with caret between `()`

#### 2.9.0.189/2.9.7.189 - Dev Build

* Add: gutter icon configuration with the IDE `Editor > General > Gutter Icons`.
  * Markdown line marker options
    * Jekyll include
    * Links and anchors
      * LINK_REF_MARKDOWN
        * LINK_ANCHOR_LINE_SELECTION
        * LINK_ANCHOR_A_TAG

      * REFERENCE_REF_FOOTNOTE
      * REFERENCE_REF_MACRO
  * Flexmark Java line markers
    * FLEXMARK_SPEC_FILE
    * FLEXMARK_SPEC_EXAMPLE_OPTION
* Fix: `MdLineMarkerProvider` no gutter icon for link address and one for anchor. Only anchor
  icon.
* Fix: fake psi navigation elements to return `null` for `getContainingFile()` to disable
  default IDE navigation and force it to use `Navigatable.navigate()` of the element.
  * Fix: `MdUrlFakePsiElement`
  * Fix: `MdLineSelectionFakePsiElement`
* Fix: rebuild for new snapshot build of IDE.
* Fix: update GitHub link resolver tests

#### 2.9.0.187/2.9.7.187 - Dev Build

* Fix: after format document scroll caret into view.
* Add: option to disable list item smarts if wrap on typing is disabled to allow quick disabling
  of list smart keys without adding extra shortcuts or actions.
  * when disabled, disable ENTER list smart key.
  * when disabled, disable backspace list smart key.
* Fix: copy selection reference would add 1 line at the end
* Fix: use `BuilderBase.removeExtensions()` to remove `TypographicExtension` from extension
  list.
* Fix: use `MdUrlFakePsiElement.copyForLineMarkerNavigation()` to create fake URL which returns
  null for containing file so line marker navigation uses `navigate()` instead of default
  implementation.

#### 2.9.0.185/2.9.7.185 - Dev Build

* Fix: missing partial link refs from copy because of typographic extension messing with
  undefined ref link as if it was text.

#### 2.9.0.183/2.9.7.183 - Dev Build

* Add: disabled reasons as extra text to menu actions to show why an item is disabled.
* Fix: change link to reference modified and committed document before creating reference which
  uses an element from the pre-mod psi file causing invalid element access.
* Fix: no line markers for remote links with anchors because the anchor is not resolved. If an
  anchor is not resolved then line marker should be to the remote link address.
* Fix: `a` tags in headings do not show up in completions of injected markdown if only scoped
  profile `a` tag parser setting is enabled but not project. If project is enabled then scope
  does not matter. Scope should not be ignored for injected fragments.
* Fix: much improved image paste destination directory list determination (in decreasing order
  of priority):
  * last used directory for image paste in current file
  * image directories used for image links in current file, prioritized by usage count
  * image directories used for image links in markdown files in the parent directory of current
    file, prioritized by usage count across all such files.
  * directories containing image files under the current file's parent directory, prioritized by
    number of images in the directory.
* Add: rudimentary matched profiles and scopes for current file to debug which scoped profile is
  used for a file. The scopes and profile assignments are ordered with first match used.
  Figuring out which one is applied to a specific file is otherwise impossible.
* Fix: absolute links to wiki pages do not show change link to relative for mapped links. Issue
  was with link map not code. Needed to map only to actual git repo URL not local file directory
  name based URL. Had mapping to markdown3.wiki as per wiki directory name in project instead of
  markdown2.wiki as per git remote URL for the project wiki.

#### 2.9.0.181/2.9.7.181 - Dev Build

* Fix: message bus wrapper disposed test error.
* Fix: spec files no longer render HTML when option selected. This is making all spec test
  examples fail because the contained text is plain text.
* Fix: flexmark example option completions are missing all but built-in options, for completions
  need to use `PsiFile.getOriginalFile()` for cached data access since the element is a
  stand-in, its file is a copy of the original and no cache information for it is available.

#### 2.9.0.179/2.9.7.179 - Dev Build

* Fix: compatibility break in community master branch, MessageBusFactory, RestartableLexer

#### 2.9.0.177/2.9.7.177 - Dev Build

* Add: intention to change HTML entities to text, for example `&lt;` to `<`

  * add section break
  * remove markup
  * convert markup to carets and remove markup
  * add visible tab
  * add visible intellij dummy identifier
  * add visible CR
  * add test spec example break `…`
* Fix: mixed task and non-task items, toggle prefix adds it to all instead of removing only task
  item prefix or adding to only list items. Test is done.

#### 2.9.0.175/2.9.7.175 - Dev Build

* Fix: wiki links from main repo show as unresolved. All vcs roots in SNAPSHOT build of IDE were
  not seen at initialization.
* Fix: diagnostic/4280, editor is disposed.

#### 2.9.0.173/2.9.7.173 - Dev Build

* Fix: update `flexmark-java` to reworked rich char impl.

* Fix: update to fixed reverse-regex
* Fix: update to latest flexmark-java

#### 2.9.0.167/2.9.7.167 - Dev Build

* Fix: spec examples without options have no line marker to Java test case file.
* Fix: spec file link refs contain `&nbsp;` after document format
* Fix: spec file once references show unused, they don't change to used, cache invalidation
  issue. When computing a key, getting another key only added dependency if that key was
  computed, instead of always adding dependency to parent transaction.
* Fix: psi set/map to not convert psi file keys to original file. Only elements reference
  `originalElement()`
* Fix: spec example injections replaced any section content with ast section of new element
* Fix: cached key version did not check it the key is still valid, so if key was not recomputed
  then dependents would think it is still valid.
* Add: all style and parser options to test options to allow quick test creation and minimize
  reluctance to create test because needed options are missing.
* Add: tests for cached referenced map and definition count map.
* Fix: format with wrap text disabled would double the indent of continuations every time.
* Fix: paragraph wrapping now working in document format
* Fix: enabled wrap on typing. Caret position tracking is off. Needs attention.

#### 2.9.0.165/2.9.7.165 - Dev Build

* Fix: clean up use of smart data lib where char sequences are not involved
* Fix: clean up psi edit adjustment use, eliminate null adjustment and always provide file/chars
  for the instance.

#### 2.9.0.163/2.9.7.163 - Dev Build

* Fix: localize lex parser state access
* Fix: disable all use of smart data, no table formatting, no wrapping until fixed

#### 2.9.0.161/2.9.7.161 - Dev Build

* Fix: Beta 2019.3 surprises. SmartData library not compatible with Kotlin 1.3.60 and needs to
  be removed.

#### 2.9.0.159/2.9.7.159 - Dev Build

* Fix: formatter control ignored when child of list item. Was by design. removed test for top
  level element.
* Fix: html comment was improperly parsed to PSI if had leading whitespace which CommonMark
  passes on as is, with leading non-indenting whitespace.

#### 2.9.0.157/2.9.7.157 - Dev Build

* Fix: update flexmark-java 0.59.42, refactored and renamed `RichSequence`
* Fix: format would loose custom option params on flex example options

#### 2.9.0.155/2.9.7.155 - Dev Build

* Fix: wrong offset use in MdInlineCode for offset in parent. Not handling multi-line content
  with prefixed parents.

#### 2.9.0.153/2.9.7.153 - Dev Build

* Fix: `UrlExtractingTextCollectingVisitor` did not collect typographic node text
* Fix: plain text (JSON) was asking about HTML to markdown conversion.
* Fix: HTML paste, if plain text == HTML then disable HTML paste button
* Fix: language injections for fenced code blocks and indented code. Too vigorous cleanup in
  plugin.xml. Removed manipulator in error.
* Fix: inline code injection. Returned wrong range in parent. Did not handle blank lines or more
  than 3 marker chars `` ` `` at beginning of a paragraph. Now for the latter, inserts `&nbsp;`
  before the inline-code.
* Fix: `PsiSet` and `PsiMap` to not check equivalency of keys for `PsiFile`

#### 2.9.0.151/2.9.7.151 - Dev Build

* Add: compound spec-example sections, to combine previous lower level headings via `splice(" -
  ")` to allow hierarchical structure view for spec files
* Fix: formatter to properly generate spec example section names for compound sections
* Fix: example option renaming across all related files: markdown/java from spec resource and
  java classes from class super/sub class defining the same option.
* Fix: structure view for spec files to allow hierarchies of sections, same as headings
* Fix: make undefined example options resolve to test class for the spec file for navigation.

#### 2.9.0.149/2.9.7.149 - Dev Build

* Fix: annotator for example options
* Fix: flexmark project data cache to have super/subclass and super nesting information resolved
  at data computation time. `RenderingTestCase` and first implementor of `SpecExampleProcessor`
  to have level 0, all inheritors add +1.
* Fix: java psi file cache to use project sub/super/level information and provide options sorted
  deeper subclass overrides super classes.
* Fix: resolved literals should have literal name with sorted by class hierarchy literal
  expressions for all classes in the hierarchy which define the literal of that name.

#### 2.9.0.147/2.9.7.147 - Dev Build

* Fix: cached data dependencies rewrite. Now done like the IDE cached data management but with
  transactions and automatic data key dependency additions.

#### 2.9.0.145/2.9.7.145 - Dev Build

* Fix: spec-example spec file name resolution should use class relative for non absolute
  resource paths like the tests themselves.
* Fix: Add proper spec resource string to spec file resolution using module and module roots
* Fix: flexmark html settings to provide default sections if no sections are defined in
  persisted state
* Fix: enable in place rename for Java side options.

#### 2.9.0.143/2.9.7.143 - Dev Build

* Add: add global invalidation lock to use for all dataKey invalidation actions
* Add: invalidation nesting for invalidation log indentations
* Fix: `CachedDataSet` was not removing invalidated keys, only propagating invalidation to their
  dependents
* Fix: Cache logging now with low 4 digits of millisecond timestamp and thread id to show
  multi-thread activity.
* Fix: transaction manager locks key/data cache lock for the duration of get/compute to prevent
  access to incomplete results from other threads
* Fix: transaction manager now starts get/compute for initial transaction in `readAction`,
  nested transactions are part of it.
* Fix: all cachedData add/remove/test are synchronized to map instance for access only. For
  computations a lock per dataKey/dataCache is used to lock get/compute to ensure consistency
  from different threads.

#### 2.9.0.141/2.9.7.141 - Dev Build

* Fix: remove erroneous optimization when registering dependencies which caused dependencies to
  be missed
* Fix: add callback to monitors that all container dependencies were removed, as occurs on
  `CachedDataSet.clearCachedData()`
* Fix: remove cache clearing on `updateContainerState()` call. Only restart highlights is
  needed.

#### 2.9.0.139/2.9.7.139 - Dev Build

* Fix: custom options highlight red for super classes of test without their own `SPEC_RESOURCE`
  definition.

* Fix: add transactions for getting cached key values, without transaction can `getOrNull()`
  * invalidation occurs outside of transactions so removing a key is not transactional, neither
    is dependency checking

    automatically adds the key to its parent transaction

  invalidates dependencies before highlighting run, which is ideal to force recomputation of
  invalid data used for highlighting.

* Fix: list item's second paragraph children get the item prefix, converting them to items.
  Introduced by a fix for the culprit below.
  * Fix: List item whose first child is block quote, on format/wrap on typing looses its item
    prefixes and becomes indented text.
* Add: HTML paste option to convert links to references, add pasted link types:
  * Add: document information so existing reference definitions can be re-used instead of
    creating duplicates.
  * None - skip element generating no text
  * Text - just text or alt text
  * Explicit - explicit link/image
  * Reference - reference link/image with reference definition
  * HTML - paste HTML as is
* Add: Intention on auto-link looking text to Wrap in `<>` so `Auto links` parser option could
  be disabled and still get annotations for auto-link text.
* Fix: [#708, Empty element in simplified structure view when using just url as header text],
  now falls back to using the heading as is if plain text gathering results in empty text
* Add: task list option to simple structure view to display task list items under the heading
  section with filter options:
  * Add: structure view type combo in settings:
    * simple - headings only
    * simple tasks - headings and tasks
      * only headings with tasks
      * to show completed tasks,
      * incomplete tasks,
      * empty item tasks (either complete or incomplete)
    * detailed - all elements and sections
  * Fix: Badge filter should filter out any headings without tasks
  * Fix: empty tasks should not add to count but should affect the badge color and badge display
  * Fix: navigation from editor to list item should be based on position at the end of the line
    but for empty items on the last non-blank of the line.
* **Link text completions**
  * disable automatic completion on char typed if auto-popped-up.
  * remove query string from link text suggestions
* **emoji completions**
  * only auto popup if lowercase or _ is preceding the caret.
  * work properly and in all elements
  * ENTER completion of emoji shortcut in heading adds `:` and tail of heading line
* Add: `Not Sorted, delete unused` and `Sorted, delete unused` options to all applicable
  elements to remove unused references during document format.
* Fix: formatting list sort by task completion status broken in 2.8.0/2.8.2
* Fix: [#702, Setext header marker equalization on ENTER broken]
* Fix: block quote and list items should not be inserted while in multi-line non-wrapping inline
  elements like inline math and multi-line url image
* Fix: Do not allow wrapping of inline math. Otherwise wrapping on `\` without a following space
  creates issues with rendering. For now math inline elements are treated like explicit links
  and images. If they do not fit on a line, they are moved to a line by themselves.
* Fix: visitor base impl was not visiting children of inline elements
* Fix: ENTER after empty task item inserts extra blank line
* Add: disable indent on paste for markdown documents
* Fix: Lexer based syntax highlighter to work correctly for restarted lexing. This is still slow
  because re-parse can only be done starting with file level items. Annotator is still be best
  choice for markdown syntax highlighting.
* Add: GitLab inline math elements to distinguish them from inline code.
* Fix: reverse the lexer/annotator editor swapping. Start all files with lexer, then switch
  write enabled ones to annotator. This way syntax highlighting gets performed immediately but
  the greatest benefit is to have Markdown syntax highlighting in injected language elements
  which use lexer syntax highlighting.
* Fix: Remove swap readonly editor highlighter option it is no longer used.
* Fix: re-parse markdown editors when annotator type is changed.
* Add: GitLab inline math attributes to distinguish from inline code
* Add: Task item complete text attribute
* Fix: GitHub file line selection anchors not to validate except for form: `L#-L#`.
* Fix: GitLab file line selection anchors not to validate except for form: `L#-#`.
* Add: Anchor quick fix to convert between GitHub and GitLab line selection anchors when the
  wrong form is used. ie. GitHub with GitLab form and vice versa.
* Add: Editor option Annotator: `Ignore fenced code content`
* Fix: unresolved link annotation shows up 2x in inspection results
* Fix: https:// link to issues of another module in a project showing as unresolved
* Add: option to validation inspections to ignore elements in fenced code, ignored by default.
* Add: apply to all in file intention to `Delete unused reference`
* Fix: rename file quick fixes failing with illegal file name.
* Add: error annotations to error highlight project view files
* Add: Inspection for Unicode
  ['LINE SEPARATOR' (U+2028)](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2028/index.htm)
  which is used to force line separator which will not wrap.
* Fix: doubling of TODO items and spelling errors, was caused by having comment nodes in HTML
  blocks which had HTML language injected. Causing comments to be processed twice: once for each
  language.
* Fix: Enable in-place renaming of all elements where possible.
* Fix: file move refactoring to handle IDE and refactoring listener both calling move handler
  for the same file. Happens when directories are moved. This was causing unadjusted link
  because the IDE called the prepMove **after** the file was already moved, useless because all
  the relative links are now not guaranteed to work. Now works because IDE gets results computed
  for refactoring listener before file is moved.
* Fix: line markers for ref links and images don't show up in gutter, broken by element type
  cleanup.
* Fix: node class refactoring for list and list item left some code testing for unordered list
  item when generic list item was intended.
  * Renumber list items in formatting always resets the first item to 1. even when that option
    is not selected.
  * BACKSPACE gets rid off the ordered item prefix when editing any non-first list item, works
    fine if `Backspace removes empty item setting` is off.
* Fix: completed task items on ordered items get converted to simple ordered items on ENTER
  insertion of another item.
* Add: Splitting a paragraph in the middle (not list item) should automatically add hard break
  spaces at the end of the old line so it is not wrapped.
  * Add: smart key option for ENTER to add hard-break spaces when splitting a line
* Fix: Add awareness to formatter for `<!-- IGNORE PREVIOUS -->` comment being associated with a
  reference and move it with the reference when formatting.
* Fix: loose list with empty item not recognized as double spaced
* Fix: ENTER on empty task list item inserts blank line after deleting task item prefix
* Fix: typing before indented paragraph swallows characters instead of inserting them before the
  paragraph.
* Fix: typing right at first character of indented text doubles the typed character. Cannot
  reproduce.
* Fix: weird behavior when ENTER hit at end of bullet item with ordered item children. Get
  spliced new first item `1. X` followed by old item `2.` on the same line. Cannot reproduce.
* Fix: insert line item on ENTER **after the end of the item text** should insert child item if
  original item has children. ie. as if insert before was done on first child item
  * Fix: inserting when the first child is an empty item removes the child and inserts blank
    lines.
* Fix: ENTER when inserting new task item above the current one should clear the task done
  marker in the new task item and leave the done marker for the old item. Right now it does the
  reverse.
* Fix: task item prefix was not handled on ordered list items for insert/renumber
* Fix: insert after end of ordered list item with child task item splits the next line in two
  but does not add prefix
* Fix: in fixed indent mode BACKSPACE indents ignoring fixed indent config.
* Fix: reference sort to be done on normalized id not actual id
* Fix: [#715, Completed task list items not rendered with checkmark]
* Fix: `AUTOLINKS` extension is now an option for annotation syntax highlighter. Previously, it
  was always enabled regardless of parser settings.
* Fix: inline reference intention only appears on the reference part of `[reference
  text][reference]`, it should appear for the whole element.
* Add: Intention to match ref link case to reference id case when the two don't match, with All
  in file intention option
* Fix: remove separate line icon for link and anchor. Only add combined navigate to header.
* Add: Intention on selected text or word to add Abbreviation if this parser option is selected.
* Add: File inspection for large files with auto-links parser option enabled.
* Add: convert all auto-links to <http://> which work without needing to parse all text for
  possible link.
* Add: Inspection to find possible unwrapped auto-links in text and convert them to `<>` wrapped
  auto-links
* Add: intention to remove ref link text when it matches the id, also offer to do the same after
  refactoring the ref id and it matches text
* Add: to line marker tooltip the element's identifying characteristics so can see which element
  from the line is being referred to by the line icon.
* Fix: initialization issues in paste options form and dialog
* Add: HTML options from editor settings to show disabled paste plain text and paste html
  buttons.
* Add: dropped link insert as option: `Link`, `Ref Link & Reference`, `Reference Only`
* Fix: remote content first heading makes no sense, use title with fallback to first heading
* Fix: [#704, NoClassDefFoundError on 2019.1 EAP with JBRE], JRE 11 support
* Fix: diagnostic/2477, Desktop API not supported on the current platform
* Fix: [#710, Memory leak in HTML preview window], swing HTML preview had a memory leak.
* Add: [#709, New Icon looks bad on dark background], option to use old document icons.
* Fix: ignore rendering profiles with no name. Do not know how it occurred but when it did it
  was incomplete and caused headaches to figure out why the plugin was screwing up parser
  settings.
* Fix: HTML Export with `Use style attribute` not to add `<meta http-equiv="content-type"
  content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">`
* Fix: diagnostic/2335, `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: com.intellij.util.KotlinUtils.`, must have
  been a new addition to the library.
* Fix: diagnostic/2348, `Parameter specified as non-null is null: method` for drag/drop files
* Fix: diagnostic/2344 illegal access `EditorWindow.INITIAL_INDEX_KEY`, static field was
  temporarily made package private between 2016/10 and 2018/06 in the API.
* Fix: [#711, Editor -> Toggle Editor Layout setting is not saved.]
* Fix: [diagnostic/2556](https://vladsch.com/admin/diagnostics/2556) Index out of Bounds.
* Fix: Toggle task item done does not work for ordered task list items

## 2.8.2 - Bug Fix & Enhancement Release

* Fix: icon sizes for non-hdpi displays
* Add: option to insert references instead of links, if there is no name conflict, no dialog is
  brought up and the reference is simply inserted into the text.
* Fix: backspace on a blank line after the first bullet list item text deletes list item prefix.
* Add: All in file intentions for image <--> code convesions:
  * codecogs math to multi-line url image
  * gravizo uml to multi-line url image
  * image to fenced code math
  * image to inline math
  * image to plant uml fenced code
* Add: Condition to codecogs image to fenced code intention to only do conversions if the image
  is the only element in a paragraph and the reverse condition to convert to inline math. This
  way apply to all will only convert elements which can be converted back to images without
  changing the file layout.
